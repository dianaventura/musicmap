# Music Mapping and Soundscapes 

## üß† Idea
Synesthetic Soundscapes is an interdisciplinary project that blends data science, natural language processing (NLP), and generative music. This tool analyzes text sentiment and maps emotions to unique sound compositions, allowing users to "hear" the emotional tone of written content.

## üéØ Goal
The primary aim of this project is to explore the intersection of computational linguistics and music, transforming emotion-laden text into AI-assisted soundscapes.

## üìç Why?
- **Interdisciplinary:** Combines psychology, music theory, and AI.
- **Creative:** Enables writers, musicians, and artists to express emotions through music.
- **Academically Valid:** Sentiment analysis is a well-researched NLP field, and generative music is an emerging area of AI study.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Uses NLP models (VADER/BERT) to classify text sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
   - Extracts emotion levels such as joy, sadness, anger, or calmness.
2. **Emotion-to-Music Mapping:**
   - Converts sentiment scores into musical parameters:
     - **Tempo:** Higher for positive emotions, lower for melancholic tones.
     - **Key Signature:** Major for happiness, minor for sadness.
     - **Chord Progression:** Generated dynamically based on detected sentiment.
3. **Generative Music Engine:**
   - Uses MIDI generation libraries (e.g., Magenta, MIDIUtil) to produce soundscapes.
   - Outputs an audio file representing the emotional landscape of the input text.
4. **Interactive Interface:**
   - A Python script with a simple user interface to input text and hear the generated sound.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NLP Libraries**: VADER, TextBlob, or BERT for sentiment analysis.
- **Music Generation**: Google Magenta, MIDIUtil.
- **Frontend (Optional)**: Streamlit for a simple web-based interface.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- **Real-time text-to-music API** for interactive artistic applications.
- **Integration with visualizations** to create an audiovisual experience.
- **Fine-tuned ML models** to improve emotion detection accuracy.
